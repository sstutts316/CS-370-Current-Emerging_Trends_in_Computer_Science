Pirate Intelligent Agent: TreasureHuntGame Project Overview
Project Description
This project involved developing a Pirate Intelligent Agent capable of efficiently navigating through a maze to find a treasure. The core challenge was to imbue the agent with the intelligence to make optimal decisions within a predefined maze environment.

Given Code
Environment Setup: A maze represented as an 8x8 matrix, with 0s and 1s indicating obstacles and navigable paths, respectively.
Basic Agent Framework: Initial scaffolding for the agent, including basic functionalities to perceive and interact with the maze environment.
Visualization Tools: Functions provided to visually depict the agent's movements and the path it takes within the maze.
Developed Code
Deep Q-Learning Algorithm: Implementation of deep Q-learning to enable the agent to learn optimal paths through trial and error.
Neural Network Model: Construction of a neural network model to approximate the Q-value function, guiding the agent's decision-making process.
Exploration-Exploitation Strategy: Integration of an epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration of new paths with exploitation of previously learned paths.
